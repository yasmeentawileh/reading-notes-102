# What's the use of functions?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements) which will make it more easier.
# Function declaration
To create a function you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achive its task inside the curly brackets.
