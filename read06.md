# How computers work?
in simple way the computer take the informations which called inputs store it process it and then output the result.
input tools: microphone,camera,keyboard,mouse
# How the data stored and presented 
the smallest informatin can the computer store called a bit whith more bites you will get more complex informations ,the inputs transfer to binary numbers which are zero and one, zero means off or false and one means on or true these binary numbers enters a millions of teeny electronic components which come together to form a circuits.
# types of circuits?
## not circuit
the circuits takes an electrical signal on or off and flips it, if the signal is 1 the circuit will give you a zero and if the signal is zero it will give you a one
## and circuit 
the circuits take two electrical signal if one of them is zero the output is zero the only way to get one as a result the both signals must be one
## or circuit 
the circuits take two electrical signal if one of them is one the output is one the only way to get zero as a result  the both signals must be one
### note: all the calculations are made on CPU
