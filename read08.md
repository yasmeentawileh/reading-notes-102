# comparison tools:
1. ==
this means equal to it gives true if they are equal.
2. !=
not equal to it gives true if they are not equal.
3. ===
strict equal to they must by the same data type and value to gives true.
4. !==
strict not equal to it gives true if they are not the same data type or the same value or both.
5. >
greater than checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right if it's greater it will give you true
6. <
less than cheks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right if it's less it will give you true.
7. >=
greater than or equal checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal the number on the right if it's greater or equal it will give you true.
