# Version controls
**types of version controls**
1. Local Version Control

 A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

 2. Centralized Version Control

This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. This streamlined the collaboration process (by eliminating the need to involve all local databases), allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team members’ activities with certain files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges.

3. Distributed Version Control

The DVCS allows for multiple mirrored repositories, programmers working in teams can collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project, which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows.

# What is GIT?
Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. it mostly relies on  local operation and it's track every single change applied to any file or directory , using GIT minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files.
# GITS files status
**1. commited**

Data is securely stored in a local database

**2. modifed**

**3. staged**

Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
